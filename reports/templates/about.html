      <p>The Refugee Reporting Resource was created to help newsrooms provide more complete and multi-dimensional coverage of local refugee communities. To accomplish this, the American Press Institute worked with summer fellow Emily Case to develop a guide that includes a searchable refugee resettlement database and resources about covering local refugee communities. </p>
