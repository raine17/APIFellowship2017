        <p id="bso">Refugee resettlement data is an entry point into new stories, but it can only provide so much information. It can't illustrate important nuances like religious minorities, births and deaths, or previously resettled communities, for example.
        <br>
       <p id="bso">This is where reporting comes in. To help with this, we've created and compiled numerous resources for covering refugee populations. Check out our created resources to get more in-depth data on refugee populations and learn more about best practices in covering them. For more background information on refugees and resettlement, see our "Other resources" section below.
